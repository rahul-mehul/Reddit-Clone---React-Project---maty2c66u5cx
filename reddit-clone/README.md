 ## Project Steps

- **Step 1 Homepage**
    - Create the homepage which displays recent posts from the users. You can store fake data and display it.
    - You can store the data in the local storage in the format given below
    
    ```jsx
    const posts = [
        {
            postedBy: "Kunal",
            postText:
                "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.",
            upVotes:3,
    				downVotes:1
        },
    ];
    ```
    
    - If the user is not logged he should not be able to upvote or downvote a post.
- **Step 2 Login Functionality**
    - Add the login feature to the App (for development purpose you can have a predefined list of usernames and passwords).
    - You can use the local storage to store the username and passwords.
    - If the user is logged in he should be able to upvote and downvote a post and also have the option to add a new post.
- **Step 3  Adding a new post**
    - A logged is user should be able to add a new post.
    - A new post should have a title and description and image (which can be optional).
    - You can store the new posts data in local Storage
    - User should also be able to upvote and downvote existing posts on the home page
- **Step 4 Adding upvotes and downvotes to a post**
    - Every Post should have the feature of upvotes and downvotes which can be clicked by a user only once.
